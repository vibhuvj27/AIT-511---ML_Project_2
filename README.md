# AIT-511---ML_Project_2
Two ML classification projects:  
1. Smoker Status Prediction (Binary) – Predict smoker/non-smoker from bio-signals (age, BP, cholesterol, etc.) using Logistic Regression, SVM Classifier and Neural Networks (2,3,5,7 hidden layers)
2. Forest Cover Type Prediction (Multi-class) – Classify 7 forest types from cartographic features (UCI dataset, 581k samples) with Logistic Regression, SVM Classifier and Neural Networks (2,3,5,7 hidden layers)
